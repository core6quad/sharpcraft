## how to run
Just get the binary from releases or build from source

## Console commands
this game has some console commands:

tp X Y - teleport
gen radius - generate chunks aground you in a defined radius

## Trivia

- if you will reach the 32bit integer limit world would just continue on
the negative version of said limit, making it somewhat infinite
- by running **gen 99999** you can *totally nuke your drive*
